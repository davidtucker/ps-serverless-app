# Serverless Development on AWS

__This learning path has not launched yet. Once launched the links will be added.__

This repository is for the Serverless Development on AWS learning path for Pluralsight. 

## Approach

This learning path is focused on creating a modern full-stack serverless application on AWS using real world techniques and approaches.  It follows the following opinionated concepts:

* It leverages a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) structure with [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)
* The backend services are created for Node.js wtih JavaScript and are exposed as REST API's
* The web application is created using React using hooks
* The infrastructure is defined with TypeScript using the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
* Continuous delivery is implemented using an AWS CDK Pipeline
* No third-party services are leveraged as the focus is on a cloud-native approach with AWS only
